## üìù About me.
Software development enthusiast.
<br>Full Stack Developer _(in progress)_.
<br>Started to get into the world of programming since 15 years old as a hobby with friends, developing a game server for people to join. When my friends and I got tired of the game we split up and I didn't program again until I was 21 years old during the COVID-19 quarantine. I started to self-taught and quickly fell in love with the world of software development.<br>Then I realized that this is what I want to do with my life.

Nowadays I find myself studying, reading and learning as much as I can about software.
